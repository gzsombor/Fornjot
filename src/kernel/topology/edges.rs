    /// As of this writing, each edge is approximated multiple times, for the
    /// triangulation of each face that it is adjacent to. This might not be
    /// desirable, for the following reasons:
    ///
    /// 1. Efficiency: Approximating an edge once and caching the result might
    ///    realize a performance gain.
    /// 2. Correctness: It is conceivable that the same edge is approximated
    ///    differently for each of its neighboring faces, if the algorithm used
    ///    is not fully deterministic. If that were to happen, this would result
    ///    in a triangle mesh where the triangles don't connect.
    ///
    /// Only approximating an edge once, and then referring to that
    /// approximation from then on where needed, would take care of these two
    /// problems.
    ///
    /// To achieve this, some infrastructure improvements would have to be made:
    ///
    /// 1. Edges would need to be identified by a unique ID, and the
    ///    approximations in the data structure returned here would need to be
    ///    associated with that ID, to allow for retrieval.
    /// 2. Edges would need to be approximated in curve coordinates.
    ///    - As of this writing, they are computed in model coordinates, then
    ///      converted to surface coordinates, which is just a nuisance.
    ///    - Directly computing them in surface coordinates would be an
    ///      improvement, but would obviously not allow for the reuse of results
    ///      that is imagined here.
    ///    - Hence computing the approximation in curve coordinates, then
    ///      converting it to surface coordinates for the triangulation, seems
    ///      to be the prudent choice.
    ///
    /// In addition, it should be noted that edge approximations in curve
    /// coordinates could be reused even for different edges, as long as those
    /// edges are distance-preserving transformations (isometries) of the
    /// approximated edge.
    ///
    /// To realize all this, it is probably best to have a single, big

    /// `&Edges` and returns the approximation for the edge. Either directly
